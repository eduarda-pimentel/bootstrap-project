# Bootstrap project

This is my first attempt at building a webpage with Bootstrap. I attempted to recreate this [Food Delivery Service template](https://themes.getbootstrap.com/preview/?theme_id=35287). The only images that I created are the ones located in the _assets_ folder. The rest I have taken from websites, and their URLs are explicit in the HTML code. 

My objective was to make the webpage design responsive using only HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

There are some improvements that I haven't been able to implement, such as:
* Making the navbar sticky
* Add a sticky shopping footer to the bottom of the page
* Add a language selection menu at the bottom of the footer
* Making the review section more responsive, by displaying each review individually
